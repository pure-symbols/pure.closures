# *pure project* üß´

~~~
üß´ implement all by nothing but only lexical closure . üß¨

## Intro

This is a theoretical verification in *Functional Programming* studies.

The only one necessary thing of a language for this pure project is a ***lexical closure*** feature, means it band its *free variables* by the ***lexical scoping***, not the *dynamic scoping*, and this also called ***closure*** or ***function closure***. That means there is a *first-classed function means all function is valve* and *it will pick all the symbol **where it be defined** which is needed by it-self*. With out such thing, all of this projec shall not works.

And with such feature, we can make these things: 

- *Laziness* -- without *lexical closure* feature, then we'll must get the *laziness* just from a language design and implementation.
- *Currying* -- if we don't have the *closure* feature, then we cannot do any *currying* things that means no *(elegant) pipe* then I shall give up this *pure project* at its begin.
- *Tuple* -- we can get numbers of values and let them applies one by one onto a picker, and then we just give a specific picker to get the specific value we've just given in.
- *Iterator* -- we have the *tuple* now and an *iterator* (or *List* or *Sequence*) is just a special 2 length tuple whith a value as the *head* and a closure as the *tail* which can just get the next such tuple. (and you can do almost everything with it such as you can just simply take a `Iterator <Tuple <...>>` as a `Table <...>` ...)
- *Pipeline* -- a simple pipe is just a `Œªxf.fx` while we're all in currying style and a `Y(Œªgxf.g(fx))` could be a yard that always can give a closure to its next parameter, and with such thing we can just play pure functional programming with out any *OO Method* grammar to make the nesting callings be listing callings.

And, with these things, we can do almost (maybe full) things about the compute works, and just with clear, clean, and declarative code expressions.
