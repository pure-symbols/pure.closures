This is a theoretical verification in *Functional Programming* studies.

Things I will build should just base on the *first classed function* feature. If there should be some static classes annotation, only use type aliases. An annotation of types should just show the structure of a data.

Something specific: 

- In TS/JS, I would use one more thing: object, similar with [records in OCaml](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/data/records_tuples.html).
