# *pure project* üß´

~~~
üß´ implement all by nothing but only lexical closure . üß¨

## Intro

This is a theoretical verification in *Functional Programming* studies.

The only one necessary thing of a language for this pure project is a ***lexical closure*** feature, means it band its *free variables* by the *lexical scoping*, not the *dynamic scoping*, and this also called ***closure*** or ***function closure***. That means there is a *first-classed function means all function is valve* and *it will pick all the symbol **where it be defined** which is needed by it-self*. With out such thing, all of this projec shall not works.

And with such feature, we can make these things: 

- *Laziness* -- without *lexical closure* feature, then we'll must get the *laziness* just from a language design and implementation.
- *Currying* -- if we don't have the *closure* feature, then we cannot do any *currying* things that means no *(elegant) pipe* then I shall give up this *pure project* at its begin.
- *Tuple* -- we can get numbers of values and let them applies one by one onto a picker, and then we just give a specific picker to get the specific value we've just given in.
- *...* -- ...
